- Created mentoring platform to earn crypto tokens called Athena Mentor for mentors and mentees to earn tokens after booking learning sessions with each other using Next.js for booking mentors and video conferencing, NestJS for booking service, notification service, and reward token service to user digital wallets.
- Designed and developed tokenomics for ATH token by developing:
  - Investor vault smart contract for investor listings including investor wallet addresses, investment budgets, and tokens held during vesting periods after dates for dividends where investors should receive ATH tokens following their investments after approval by project team using multisignature to approve transactions.
  - Staking and swap systems using smart contracts to enable ATH token holders to stake and receive rewards, and swap smart contracts to peg USDT with ATH tokens through swapping pools where USDT is added from mentoring system service charges.
