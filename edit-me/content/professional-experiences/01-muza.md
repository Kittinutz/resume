# Livibe

- Built prototype rhythm-synchronized LED wristband device with infrared communication using Arduino and ESP32 devices.
- Built software as control center for wristband devices using ReactJS, Node.js, and DMX protocol to control lighting heads with embedded LED infrared transmitters to communicate with wristband devices having infrared receivers.
- Created virtual stage for overview monitoring of wristband colors by receiving DMX data via Node.js and displaying 3D models on web applications using ReactJs.
- Researched computer chips and developed infrared transmitter boards to replace LED boards in moving head lights and concert lights using electronic skills and EasyEDA software to build LED circuits.
- Researched computer chips and developed wristbands from scratch using EasyEDA, building wristbands with STM32 chips as microprocessors and coding wristband software using STM32CubeIDE with C++
- Ordered wristbands from Chinese factories by communicating with Chinese suppliers using virtual thinking.

## Muza

- Built Muza wallet application to connect digital wallets (e.g., MetaMask) and internal wallets for retrieving digital asset holdings to redeem privileges using React Native, NestJS with WalletConnect service.
- Built NFTs for customers who create privileged content to send to Muza wallet users using Solidity to create smart contracts on Polygon chain.
- Built privilege redemption creation system to create redeemable privilege content in Muza wallet by cross-checking with NFT smart contract details on-chain supporting Polygon chain using NestJS as backend and PostgreSQL as database.
- Designed and built CI/CD to deploy backend services to AWS EC2 with Dokku using Docker and version control (Git) with "push to deploy" methodology including unit test checking.
- Passed audit for Muza wallet application to ensure quality and trust for users by Reconix company that performed penetration testing and certification.
