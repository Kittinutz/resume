Hi, my name is Kittinut (Tony). I've been working in software engineering since 2018, primarily with JavaScript and TypeScript. I'm also learning other languages like Python, Rust, Go, C, C++, and PHP.

I'm passionate about research, problem-solving, and developing products that help companies grow - it brings me joy to work on something I truly love.

In my free time, I enjoy traveling to explore new places, playing guitar, playing Dota 2, and cooking (especially beef dishes, which is my favorite hobby).
